## SMART Questions are for smart people, The importance of asking questions
The importance of asking smart questions is a necessity for this field. In the realm of computer science, you need to learn how to learn. It is a very vast in the sense that the technology used may not be even exist in 10 years time, so it is part of our job to keep learning and staying up to date. With this in mind, asking questions and learning from others is expectation and necessary to do well. We need to learn from others, and others will learn from you.

## Learn from the good, and learn how not to from the bad

An example of a bad question I found is here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65482702/why-is-my-for-loop-not-working-or-is-it-something-else-that-is-causing-problems

This question does not take the time to put in a good title for help. It doesn't state the error that they are having and just simply states "help me my code is not working"

An example of a good quesiton is https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77884792/how-to-override-or-pipe-a-nested-builder-with-built-value

This question is first built in good English, and it is precise and clear what the person is trying to ask. Secondly by viewing the link the person provides accurate detail of what they are doing and the troubleshooting steps they are trying to do. This person also doesnt grumble or complain, but simply list everything they could and hoped other people can help them provide a solution.

## Insights

I think something that stuck out to me the most was that the way you present your question can drastically change the result. By just wording a question differently it one shows better understanding of whats wrong, and helps the person answering you to help you get a better response. By better stating a clearer question it also gives you a deeper understanding of the question which may even help yourself learn from it.
