### I. Introduction
The introduction of AI in education is a massive issue that will continue to get worse. I am without doubt that many students have turned in essays, and submitted assignments that were entirely written with AI. Students will use AI as there sources, and simply copy an answer with no thought at all. However I would not say it is that evil that it should be entirely gone away. Personally, I try my best to go away from AI. Often times using AI will involve me copying code without learning what it means. When I use AI I use it similar to the way I use google. If I don't know a method or function, I can rely on AI to tell me how it works.

AI is very equivalent to cheating, and because people abuse its power, I often times feel I will fall behind if I don't use it. It provides such an unfair advantage to students who can copy code and create projects quickly, compared to me trying to understand the key concepts and knowing what I am doing. Because of this I use AI to help with my understanding, in order to counteract people outvaluing me relying solely on AI. In my head I am fighting fire with fire.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
  I used AI in creating our first React Apps. An example being in the class name of the React components. I struggled udnerstanding how to center specific components, and I used AI to choose what would be best. Such as knowing "justify-content-center" and "text-center"
  2. In-class Practice WODs
  I never relied on AI for Practice WODs. I would ask questions in class, or try to solve it myself.
  3. In-class WODs
  I used ChatGPT for 1 WoD specifically towards choosing an Underscore function. I forgot the syntax to writing an _.each function and ask AI how the function worked.
  4. Essays
  I used AI in understanding what design patterns were. However I did not copy and paste anything, I used it only for learning.
  5. Final project
  I used AI to learn about ReactStates as it was a concept we didn't learn through a WoD. The final project however was mostly learned through the digits experiences.
  6. Learning a concept / tutorial
  This is what I rely on most using AI. I believe learning concepts quickly while relying on AI allows me to learn faster.
  7. Answering a question in class or in Discord
  Yes, there are often times I don't understand something, but it doesn't need someones help to solve. Relying on AI to solve very simple questions is much easier to depend on.
  8. Asking or answering a smart-question
  No, If I believe a questions is necessary enough to be a smart-question. AI is often not enough to be able to solve it. Relying on real minds is for the best here.
  9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
  I believe seeing coding examples is very nice. It is not something you can easily find online, so relying on AI to give me a quick result is very helpful.
  10. Explaining code
  Yes, I use AI to explain code by providing it examples and trying to learn from it. 
  11. Writing code
  No, I never ask ChatGPT to write me code outside of an example because often times it can't write out what I want, and I would rather write it to fully understand every concept.
  12. Documenting code
  I have never documented code using AI. I feel I need to have a human brain to understand how others would interpret my documented code.
  13. Quality assurance 
  No, for understanding the quality of what I do. It doesn't make sense for a non human intelligence to understand quality assurance.
  14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above
  I do this for small things, such as remembering characters from films or movies without relying on google. The information is often quicker and more accurate than google is.

### III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:
I believe AI can make learning and problem solving much easier and quicker. However it matters on how much you rely on it. If you simply rely on AI your learning and understanding will get worse. You won't understand what you are doing and you will fall behind. The way I use it however in learning concepts or providing examples allows AI to help me learn. Although I used AI to learn different concepts, I feel confident in what I am doing, especially when I know I could do things again without the use of AI.

### IV. Practical Applications:
I see ads often about using X application with the assistance of AI to make you faster. In some ways I believe AI is good because it stops very boring tasks to be done again. I hate having to do my bed, and cleaning the bathroom every single time I need to. This is where AI should shine. Instead AI often times feels like it removes artisitic value. Such as writing for you, creating art for you. I think AI should remove the blockers that stops you from creating art. Some things need a human mind to operate. 
### V. Challenges and Opportunities:
I experienced no challenges using AI in this course, because I never used AI as a way to give me code. AI is reliable in providing very quick solutions, but in complex situations it may tend to fall behind. AI gives me the opportunity to learn things quickly, and confiddence that it can solve many questions that someone new would rely on. AI has the chance of removing many easy to answer questions. In software engineering in which learning concepts is very important, having AI as a tool will continue to be a valuable asset.

### VI. Comparative Analysis:
One of the things I can appreciate in AI compared to a classroom is not having to publically ask a question. I don't like standing out, especially if I believe asking some questions makes me look dumb. Having AI as a resource without people seeing what I needed help with gives me much more confidence to continue learning. There are advantages to teachers however. AI cannot be a leader. It cannot be relied upon as something trusted that a whole class can look at it seriously as the one in charge. We need teachers to be the leaders of students for them to be able to learn as expected.

### VII. Future Considerations:
One of the issues I notice with AI is that it is not perfect. You cannot get exactly as you ask for, and many advanced concepts cannot be solved as of now. However as AI is still considered new it is very likely that it can eventually solve things with a 99% accuracy. If AI achieves this, it can lead to an outbreak of many advanced creations that would have taken years to study and learn from. I find AI to be both evil and exciting at the same time and it is certainly shaping up to be the next big thing.

### VIII. Conclusion:
If AI will continue to grow, I will have to learn to grow with it. AI is such a strong tool that relying on being a software developer with no knowledge of it will make you fall behind. AI is difficult to control. You can either be overreliant on it to the point you become complacent, or you can try to not use it at all and fall behind others who may simply be copying. There needs to be a good mix in the way you use it. AI can easily be an answer to all questions if it continues to become more and more accurate.
