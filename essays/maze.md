## Entering the maze

My first time really taking on the challenge of HTML and CSS came from this ICS314 course. As a result I realized it wasn't as complicated as I expected it to be. My secret is my use of AI for whenever I do not know how I can implement something. I want to make note that I do NOT use AI as a way to complete any issue I have. I use AI to help me understand how I can implement things I forgot and not needing to rely on memory for syntax. For examples I used AI to remember the differences between an unordered and ordered list in HTML, or remembering the difference between padding and margins. I find that this saves me a lot of time, as I can easily implement what I need to after. I used AI to remember the different techniques and classes in relationship to Bootstrap 5.


## It sounds so much easier than it looks

My experience with Bootstrap never felt 100% easier to be completely honest. There were some things such as implementing a navbar or footer that were much easier, but it didn't feel like it solved all the problems I had. For example I found implementing classes like 'justify-content-center' to not always work and be confusing to understand. Maybe it is simply my part for not looking through documentation clearly enough. I also relied on AI for this part because remembering all the classes felt imposible without spending a lot of time reading.

## Looking for an exit

I first struggled with Bootstrap on our assignment where we needing to mimick a website of our choice. I choose to do the 'Hermitcraft Website' a website of minecraft youtubers who I very much enjoy. This experience was a mixture of emotions. It felt very enjoyable and although I experienced many challenges I needed to solve, I never felt like giving up. This experience is very much the reason I enjoy learning computer science. I find that I often have difficulties in my courses, but in the end I often feel satisfied in my new learnings and complementions


## Out and free

I have found when recreating websites with Bootstrap or not it is hard for me to make it completely perfect. This is things such as width and proportion that I would like to make complete seemlessly is much more work than it gives back. Something that was a part of these homework assignments that I did not enjoy was a rule against using CSS styles freely. This was because it was intended to use the UI Framework. However I would assume that when making a website I wouldn't have this restriction, and I want to feel free
