## I think of design patterns like following a mathematical formula

<img width="600px" class="w3-round" src="../img/math.jpg">

I define design patterns as following a set way for completing simple common tasks. Such as how should we encounter a loop, or an if statement? Using a pattern that we understand well makes all that simpler. If we know and feel confident in how we deal with simple problems, then we can keep following the pattern in which we solve it. It also stops us from making things overly difficult. If you already know how to do something, why try to relearn or remake something that is already solved. I relate it to a math problem because math usually follows the same suit. We know how to do addition and subtraction, and by knowing how to solve these simpler tasks we can do complex calculus related to these issues.

It relates to math problems as well as people need to understand your work to get your answer. A big part of design patterns is also the fact that it encourages code reusablity and helps others in understanding what you are doing. I see online that design patterns are usually broken down into 3 groups, Behavioral, Structural, and Creational. Logically we wouldn't need to define these groups as in the end they are all just different ways to solve an issue, however they exist for the same reason design patterns exist. Design patterns break problems down into then manageable sizes. Organizing design patterns break them down even more. Instead of tackling the world, we can start one place at a time.

## Following the formula to its best

In the same way that math is hard, coding is hard putting everything together. I use design patterns when I code, but I don't believe I really think about it. If I want to implement something, I always try to break it down to a more understandable level. I think about what do I need to accomplish, and what is holding me back. When I knew what I was doing, I kept doing what I knew was right. For example when I created my own website, I struggled heavily making the first page. However, once I was able to understand that step, I kept following its same template to ensure I knew what I was doing. I think design patterns also make my work much more ledgible. In my code I usually follow similar patterns that I can understand. An example is how I usually put my variable definitions at the top of the function to keep everything organized. Theoretically anything could be a design pattern as you continue to understand what you are doing then as right.
