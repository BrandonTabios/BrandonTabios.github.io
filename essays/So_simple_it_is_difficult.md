## Javascript is so Simplistic to a Point of Fear

My experience with Javascript came with mixed feelings because of my previous knowledge of other languages. One of the languages I am quite familiar with is C. C is very barebones, and feels very robust in use. However, I found C fascinating for knowing what you are doing as you are writing code. For example as C has pointers, it makes it very complicated to keep track of what you are doing. However if you plan out what you are doing in C it makes it very obvious what you are trying to accomplish, and usually leaves no questions over what is wrong. When working in javascript it often feels almost like it hides what it does. You do not need to define something as an int, or a string, and rather anything could be anything. Even the use of the '==' means that you can easily type cast what you would want to. It almost feels like it ignores some forms of complication and will just bundle it up for later. So for a software engineering standpoint, I would honestly rather work in Java, C, or C++ with defined variables having set datatypes. It almost makes me fear that I will become complacent with how simple it is. 

## WODs a task that has no set way of preperation

So my first expectation of the practice WODs was honestly a bit of a disappointment. The first two practice WODs honestly did not feel very challenging, and the practice WOD we did in class did not feel very difficult either. However, I still don't feel a form of confidence, but rather still a form of anxiety. If the WODs are similar to the practice WODs ideally it would be simple for me to solve them easily. However, I fear that I may be over eager in my knowledge, and that I could still leave out something very obvious. Nevertheless I am still somewhat gracious we are doing WODs for this class. I hope as the professor stated in the class that these WODs no longer are something to fear, but rather something to dread. A big part of it in my eyes in confidence that you can do it, and preparing yourself for preperation in doing so. 

## Learning to learn

This class feels very weird in the way we learn, in the sense that the majority of our learning actually comes from the experiences giving us a goal in which we learn from completion. In class we actually do not do much learning, but rather clarification of the material. I have not missed an assignment, but it would certainly mean that you would fall behind instantly in doing so. A lot of computer science knowledge requires people that can learn and problem solve quickly. This field needs students who are able to learn as it becomes more and more advanced every second that we spend learning it. For me, I often find that I understand things, by understanding each component. For me to understand the big picture it requires me to understand all the things that build into it, by doing that I actually feel understanding.
