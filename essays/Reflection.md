## Stepping into the Ocean

Software Engineering is such a broad word for what it truly encompasses. It is so much more vast than people may expect. Software engineering is needed for web design, app design, game design, and it even gets broader than that. Is your application ready for mobile users? Is it easy to navigate and access? It feels to me it is impossible to master being a software engineer, the more you learn the deeper and deeper you are able to develop. At some points you can feel isolated and stranded, but at the same time when you figure things out they became all the more rewarding. Learning software engineering is a lot like learning how to swim. At the start, you need to take it slow. If you dive into the deep end you won't make it out and create anything. You need to learn the fundamentals, which in coding standards would be the respective language you are coding in. All those skills come together until you eventually feel free and confident in what you are doing. 

## Endless Possibilities

If learning to code was like learning to swim, you are not doing it alone in a pool. The amount of possibilities when it comes to software engineering is endless. There are many concepts that come into play like coding standards, and design patterns. Both coding standards and design patterns is not something set in stone. They are the framework for how code is written, and change across the languages you use, and the development of code over time. Once you learn the basic building blocks you then need to learn how to put them together. You learn how HTML/CSS can interact with Javascript, and how those eventually may be used with Python and so forth. You learn the small things in order to build the big picture.

## The Final Element Out of Your Control

The last big thing when it comes to software engineering is working with others. Projects and group work are a necessity in order for software engineers to build something grand. Like I said before you cannot completely master everything, but with the work of others, you can each be a necessary piece of a puzzle. The difficult part of working with a team is having to rely on others. You cannot control the lives of others, so you need to do your best to be reliable yourself. You also need to let go of some of your ideas and work around other people. The idea of what you are creating is not obvious to the people you are working with. You need to voice your ideas and understand the thoughts of others in order for the project to be created.

Creating something amazing is first learning the small things that make it, learning how those things come together, and working together with others for the final creation. That is software engineering.
