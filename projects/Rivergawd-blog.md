## The importance of a discord for a content creators growth

Discord is an online platform that is often used now to easily allow communication with anyone either through message or voice for free seemlessly. For content creators this is a very easy way to connect towards their fans, and create a way for themselves to grow. Some of the ways that a discord can help a content creator grow would be by alerting them when they are starting a live stream, or notifying people whenever a new video is realised. Besides notifications, content creators can also communicate directly with their community, and have community ideas being recognized with everyone. So the project in mind was to provide people a discord that provided all they could want from it.

## Working with content creators and needing to provide leadership

Most of the content creators I worked with were some of my friends, however it eventually led to me working with friends of those friends. Some of the things I needed to implement was a way for stream alerts and video notifications. I implemented this by finding online discord bots that were made for this situation. I also organized the channels and voice channels to be appropriate for what the content creator needed. I also helped advise them on advertising the discord and allow themselves to grow alongside it.

## Communication is key

One of the important things to keep in mind when working with other people that I learned is to communicate a lot of what you are doing. Often times people have ideas in their head on how they see projects. Communicating when working with someone is necessary for everyone to have their picture be reality. Some of the things that a content creator wanted was a "themed" discord. Such as having nicknames fit a role, and having channel names titled in a way that felt similar to a restaurant. I used discord directly to communicate with these people and toss ideas around. 

As a leader, I provided guidance whenever they struggled to figure something out, or decide on something. I learned as a leader you are expected to be able to solve whatever is thrown at you. Because of this I spent a good amount of time figuring out how others do things. I good thing to learn is when trying to create something good, look at similar things that are known to be good and learn from them.

This experience is something that I still do today, and something that I continue to learn from as time goes on.
