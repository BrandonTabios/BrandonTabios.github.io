## Creation

One of my desires is to be able to create a game. Not for the sake of a career, but rather having anything I want be implemented as I see fit. Game design is almost like acting like god, you can do whatever you want, literally anything as long as you know how to code it. The project was created by my friend and myself, and we are working together even today to create a game that we enjoy. We are working on the game using the Unity engine. However much of the game is still being designed, as ideas between artstyles, game play options, and stories are still being weaved together. 

The actual game itself still lacks a name. However the gameplay has been decided to be a 2d game with progression system done by defeating bosses. We looked at many different games as examples, and one of the games I am a big fan of is Terraria. Despite the fact that the game was created in 2009, the game still has a vibrant community today. Some of the things that make Terraria good is the fact that the game is completely open-world, meaning that every playthrough is unique. The gameplay itself is also quite fun. As a competitive person myself, I always enjoy games that feel difficult. If a game does not feel like it is challenging me, I feel no progress in playing it. I also was a big fan of the movement in the game such as the grappling hooks and wings that you could find. I took all this in mind when creating a game myself

## Implementation

Most of the game is still in its early progress stage. What I myself worked on now is still actually planning the game. Games have many different sides, and I wanted to create a passion project that allowed me to implement artistic ideas. A lot of my progress in this game has been lore. I wrote a lot of the story about the characters and what their ambitions are in relation to others. I also wrote about the generation of the world and universe, magic, and all of that interwined without a single line of code written. Some of the software I wrote was a character movement script. For this I used online tools to find how other devs worked on it. I also have created different character ideas, and their designs. I also did look into procedurally generated terrain. I learned about creating landscapes and even planning it out by creating voronoi diagrams to further provide a natural look to things. I also needed to communicate well with my partner so that both of our ideas can come alive

## Reflection

I learned that game design is extremely vast, especially in comparison to the popular games today. To actually be able to create and sell a game that you are proud of you need to figure out your ideas quickly. Something to keep in mind is that it is hard to complete what you are working on when you are focusing on too many things at once. Everything in game design does not have a set timeframe to complete. So it should be decided as you are working on something to set goal to complete. This would allow a clear thing to aim at as you are working. Eventually as you complete more and more that you are aiming for, then finally the creation comes to life.
